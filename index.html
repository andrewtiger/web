<h2>WEB</h2>
<p>
  The World Wide Web (WWW), commonly known as the Web, is an information system<br>
where documents and other web resources are identified by Uniform Resource<br>
Locators, which may be interlinked by<br>
hypertext, and are accessible over the Internet. The resources of the<br>
WWW are transferred via the Hypertext Transfer Protocol (HTTP) and may be<br>
accessed by users by a software application called a web browser and are<br>
published by a software application called a web server.<br>
<br>
English scientist Tim Berners-Lee invented the World Wide Web in 1989.<br>
He wrote the first web browser in 1990 while employed at CERN near Geneva,<br>
Switzerland. The browser was released outside CERN in 1991, first to<br>
other research institutions starting in January 1991 and then to the general<br>
public in August 1991. The World Wide Web has been central to the development<br>
of the Information Age and is the primary tool billions of people use to<br>
interact on the Internet.
